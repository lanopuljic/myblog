####Detecting vulnerable versions

To test if your version of Bash is vulnerable to this issue, run the following command:

 {% highlight bash %}
 env x='() { :;}; echo vulnerable'  bash -c "echo this is a test"
{% endhighlight %}
If the output of the above command looks as follows:

{% highlight text %}
OUTPUT:<br>
vulnerable<br>
this is a test
{% endhighlight %}

Patch the dame thing :)
