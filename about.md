My name is Lano and I'm a strong and passionate advocate for open source software and am working towards ultimately becoming a developer. This blog is the beginning of that goal....

My day job maintaining the running of the IT system at QBE Insurance Asia Pacific keeps me busy, but I felt that I needed to start a blog so that I have an outlet to do random sh!t I can't do at work!

I work on the blog in my spare time and try to include tutorials on how I got things up an running. Please feel free to post comments, I'd love to hear if you have a different way of getting the same result.

Thanks for checking in.

Lano.
